## 🍁 𝐇𝐢 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞

Hi I'm Ty, a Canadian fullstack software developer with around 8 years' professional experience! I've written code in various contexts including research, Android, distributed computing, web, backend, and API development.

## 💻 𝐃𝐞𝐯 𝐬𝐞𝐭𝐮𝐩

- <img src="nix-logo.png" alt="NixOS" width="14" /> **[NixOS](https://nixos.org/)** for predictability ([here](https://github.com/tjb2640/nix-config) is my system config)
- <img src="niri.png" alt="Niri WM" width="14" /> **[niri](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri)** as my Wayland compositor
- &nbsp;<img src="helix.svg" alt="hx" width="10" /> **[helix](https://helix-editor.com/)** editor (or IntelliJ for Kotlin)

I run all of this on a ThinkPad X13 gen 3 with a Ryzen 7 PRO processor. I value portability, followed by maximum performance, in a laptop over anything else.

I don't vibe code. Machine learning is a useful tool for situations like statistical recommendations, medical research, and autocomplete, but an LLM isn't a miracle cure. Local AI is cool for general coding questions but check its output. Get better as a developer in the next 5-10 years to be as futureproof as possible.

I don't maintain accounts on social networks aside from my [pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/41XPAT). I post sometimes over at [www.41xpat.ca](https://www.41xpat.ca).
